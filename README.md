# Towards Passive Labeling in 3D via Gaze Observation
This repository contains the material for my Master's Thesis at Universit√§t Bern. It was done in coop The project aims at generating segmentations in medical images using eye-tracking data from clinicians.

# Assumed file-structure
The MATLAB-code assumes the following data structure:

- matlab code/ 
- NIfTI_20140122/
  - [matlab toolbox to read NIfTI format](http://ch.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8797-tools-for-nifti-and-analyze-image)
- vlfeat/
  - [vlfeat library](http://www.vlfeat.org/)
- libsvm-3.20/
  - libsvm-3.20/
    - matlab/
      - [compiled libsvm binaries for matlab](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/)
- sqb-0.1/
  - [gradient boosting framework](https://sites.google.com/site/carlosbecker/resources/gradient-boosting-boosted-trees)
- data/
  - Dataset1/
    - Video.avi (the input video)
    - gaze-measurements/ (the recorded gaze positions in csv format -- **refer to Section "Gaze_observations"**)
      - (...).csv
    - input-frames/ (single frames of the input video in png format)
      - frame_00001.png
      - frame_00002.png
      - ...
    - ground_truth-frames/ (ground truth segmentations for the single frames of the input video in png format)
      - frame_00001.png
      - frame_00002.png
      - ...
    - (...)-descriptors/ (generated by MATLAB code)
    - trainingSet.mat (generated by MATLAB code)

  - Dataset2
    - Video.avi
    - ...

# Gaze observations #
The csv file containing gaze records should have the following structure (columns):

    frame; time; visible; x; y

- **frame:** the frame number
- **time (not currently needed):** the time of the measurement [ms from start of video] to detect whether some positions are 'old records' (it is not currently used in the project and could therefore be left blank)
- **visible:** 1, if the user pressed the space bar during the frame, 0 otherwise
- **x, y:** x- and y-positions as outputted by The Eye Tribe in relative screen coordinates (floats between [0,1])

So, an example file would look as follows:

    0; 0; 0; 0.431286; 0.412303
    1; 33; 0; 0.431181; 0.413398
    2; 66; 0; 0.430746; 0.414175
    ...
    158; 5129; 1; 0.779511; 0.382291
    159; 5163; 1; 0.780631; 0.381369
