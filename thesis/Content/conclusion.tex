\section{Discussion}
\todoWriteMore{Noise in positive labels, especially when structures in the volume / video are small (shown in chapter ``characterizing gaze''), inherent noise in negative labels, explained in chapter about pu learning.}
\todoWriteMore{A drawback of our approach is that giving the correct probabilities as inputs is not a trivial task. 
For many datasets, it is not easy to infer, from a few given gaze positions, how likely it is for other samples to be positive or negative. Datasets ``airplane'' and ``instrument'' were okay... terms dependent on spatial distance from gaze, feature-space distance from ``positive'' gaze-feature,... other datasets much more difficult...}
