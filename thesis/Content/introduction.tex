\section{Motivation}
      Medical imaging is a set of techniques to produce visual representations of the interior of a body. 
      Such images are used for clinical analysis and medical intervention, e.g. to diagnose and treat disease. 
      Techniques like computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging reveal internal structures hidden by skin and bones. 
      Clinical decisions are nowadays often based on these data, and the desire for automated systems to support the data analysis is high. 
      Yet, the data situation in medicine is not satisfying; we have in general large amounts of data produced by medical devices, but it cannot straight away be used to create automated systems to support clinicians in their everyday work, that is, for diagnosis or even treatment purposes. 

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item not enough data for training supervised methods; that's what we wanna change
      \item gaze: lower time bound
    \end{enumerate}
  
  
\section{Goal}
Produce reliable ground truth data for future training while achieving the lower bound of time given by experts seeing a structure of interest.
