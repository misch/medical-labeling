\section{Motivation}
\todoWriteMore{write about the following:}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Medical imaging is a technique, or a set of techniques, to produce 'images' / visual representations of the interior of a body. 
      \item Such images are used for clinical analysis and medical intervention, e.g. to diagnose and treat disease. 
      \item Techniques like computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging reveal internal structures hidden by skin and bones. 
      \item Data situation in medicine: In general, we have large amounts of data produced by medical devices.
      \item 3 dimensions (3rd one sometimes time, sometimes depth â€“ always refer to one "slice" as a "frame").
      \item Clinical decisions are often based on these data, but there are difficulties
      \item Using Computer Vision techniques, we hope to ... \todoRef{presentation slide 6?}.
      \item not enough data for training supervised methods; that's what we wanna change
      \item gaze: lower time bound
    \end{enumerate}
  
  
\section{Goal}
Produce reliable ground truth data for future training while achieving the lower bound of time given by experts seeing a structure of interest.
