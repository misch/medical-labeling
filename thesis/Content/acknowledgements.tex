\section*{Acknowledgement}
I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof.\ Dr.\ Paolo Favaro of the Institute for Computer Science at Universit\"at Bern for supporting me to work on this project outside of the Institute. I would also like to thank my Co-Supervisor, Dr.\ Raphael Sznitman of the ARTORG Center for Biomedical Engineering Reserach at Universit\"at Bern for the great support, encouragement and inputs during this project. Raphael was there to discuss ideas and plan further steps, and he was of great help whenever I ran into problems with the project or writing. Further, I would like to thank the other people of the Ophthalmic Technology Laboratory at the ARTORG Center who provided appreciated inputs when I was preparing my presentations or trying to figure out how to tackle certain problems. My special thanks go to Stefanos Apostolopoulos who gave me his code for collecting the eye-tracking data from the device, and who fixed the crashing server for my calculations. Also, I would like to thank my partner and my dear friends and colleagues for listening to my unclear thoughts, for keeping me motivated, for proof-reading my written thesis and for understanding that my ``only half an hours'' took sometimes longer than expected. Finally, I would like to express my profound gratitude to my parents and my brother for providing me with unfailing support and encouragement throughout my years of study and through the process of writing this thesis.
